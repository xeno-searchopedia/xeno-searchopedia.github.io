# Feedback/Bug Reports
[Leave feedback or bug reports here!](https://form.jotform.com/250710695236154)


# How to use:
- Simply search for whatever enemy, collectible, drop, FrontierNav resource, or species needed!
- Clicking on the â–¼ will extend the cell and show more information for any entity available.
- Clicking on the Pin text will add that entity to the Pinned tab for easy and fast reference. This can be especially helpful when having to grind for a large amount of materials that can potentially take 10s of hours to acquire. Think of it as a shopping list!
- Clicking on searchable elements within a cell will automatically search for that element.
- Links on the cell title will open a new tab to the Xeno Series Wiki entry for that entity.
- Links on FN sites will open a new tab to the same site on the interactive map on FrontierNav, the Interactive Video Game Wiki.
- Listed in dropped materials data are recommendations. These are opinion based and hand picked suggestions for which enemy is the best to fight to grind for each specific drop. If you know of a recommendation that is better than what is displayed on the site, please let me know via the feedback form! Do keep in mind that the recommendations are not based on a optimal builds and should assume the best recommendation for the casual player.

# TODO:
- Dark Mode

# About
The Xenoblade Chronicles X Searchopedia site was conceptualized after I completed a grueling 100% run of Xenoblade Chronicles X on the Wii U in 2022. While I loved the experience and the game, keeping track of all the things I needed to grind in order to beat the hardest fights in the game was quite a pain. This frustration mostly came from having to go back and forth through a handful of sources to research enemies and materials. The goal of this website is to be a (mostly) one-stop shop to get the main information needed for those grinds, while also supplying FrontierNav and wiki links for further, deeper information. At the very least, even if these links are necessary, at least users should be able to just come to this site, quickly search for what they need, and move on to a source that is more helpful for them. Additionally, I hope to keep open communication with the community so that requests and ideas can be integrated into the site without having to worry about navigating and modifying these other heavily-structured resources. The website is built with simple HTML, CSS, and Javascript and utilizes the flexibilty of JSON objects and arrays to easily modify and structure data.

Special shout out to [u/Vapor0907](https://www.reddit.com/r/XenobladeChroniclesX/comments/104yfgw/the_ultimate_100_guide/) for their incredible work on the [Google Sheets 100% Completion Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g0YR4M8RAHiRhCbAvV4tjXXHLEhRMrARzZMYAUGmyZ4/htmlview#). This guide heavily carried me through my own 100% playthrough and inspired me more than any other resource to make this site.

Thank you all so much!
