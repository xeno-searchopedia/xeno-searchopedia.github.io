Bedrock Hold is full of lv40+ enemies, but it's fairly easy to sneak into. FRYE:  If you choose Frye's route, the enemies you have to kill there will aggro as soon as you enter the objective circle. A lv40+ Rebel Queen Qmoeva will aggro with Frye's enemies, and the Fal-swos nearby will aggro too if you get too close in a skell, so avoid his route if you don't have a well-equipped team capable of handling those enemies. Frye's defense consists of lv37 Galdrs and lv34 Marnucks. PHOG: Phog's first defense consists of lv27 Puges and lv28 Marnucks. You can sneak through the left gate of Bedrock Hold to reach Frye undetected by the Tower Qmoevas. Phog's second defense consists of a lv31 Galdr, lv 28 Marnucks, and two lv30 Qmoevas. Only the Marnucks respawn. The Fal-swo that is normally located in the area will not spawn during the defense, so you don't have to worry about it being dragged into the fight.
