The Oc-servs and Fal-swos will still be there; but you can avoid aggroing them if you stay in the corner with the yellow circle.												
Attack on Biahno Hills	Lara Nara	Admin District	7	Have spoken to Suriella	16000	270	Fig: The Superior Form	Talk to Yusof; Talk to Lara Nara; Head to the Commercial District; Head to Industrial District; Head west of NLA and fight DE913: Dieara	Suriella's outside the BLADE Barracks; going towards the east gate

Definian Downfall	HT665: Erio	Commercial District	11	Professor B's Return;Good Fortun	43000	480	Fig: Mother;FILE-USP1480SA	Talk to Fortune; choose "Suggest Killing" for A; or "Suggest Mercy" for B; A: Head to Ganglion Antropolis in Cauldros and fight ER001: Emeroa; HP001: Harriess; JD001: Juda; Head back to the previous area of the Ganglion Antropolis to fight Rexoskell; Head to Emerian Battlegrounds in Cauldros and fight Rexoskell again; Talk to HT665: Erio; B: Talk to Doctor B; Collect 1 Resonating Madonate; 1 Octopus Board; Deliver them to Doctor B; Follow A's objectives;	There are three(really two; but one has gender-dependent objectives) possible quests this could lead to; B gives slightly more rewards; all of them give the same figure and count for The Gauntlet. If you choose A; Fortun is killed; the following quest involves steam Definian romance. If you choose B; Professor B will rewrite Fortun's personality to a goofier one; and she'll live through the rest of the game; the following quest is some goofy stuff with an easy fight.	If you get lost somehow; the Ganglion Antropolis is N/NE of FN505; at the base of the cliff wall at lava-level. The Second Barrier Key is located on a ledge directly west of the main entrance. The Third Barrier Key is in the east section; near Sharnaak's Seidr. The First Barrier Key drops from the lv55 Milsaadi Guard standing at the entrance to the Sharnaak's Seidr area. Once you've got the barrier keys; you have to go through a series of narrow passages starting in the north. You can sneak around all of the enemies by jumping around the outer edges of the rooms; and staying low in the larger room. 	The initial fight with the sisters shouldn't be difficult; but the ground Rexoskell fight is rather obnoxious. It uses a lot of gravity[or was it ether?](one steals your TP) and electric(one of which topples) attacks; as well as a multihit beam attack. Beam res should be your focus; but try not to go negative in the others. A balance of Orphean/Ma-non armor is a good idea for that; consider topple res if it's a problem. Destroying the pod thing on its right side will stop the beam barrage; while the shoulder-mounted cannon on its upper-right will stop one of its multihit gravity attacks. When it gets low on health(20%ish?) it might use a decoy aura(keep attacking until you can hit it again); while gaining another beam attack. It may also taunt you after the decoy is down; or 'guard' and inflict spike counterdamage when it's hit. You'll want a full part of at least ~lv50. The second fight should be fine if you've made it that far; and you can always use your skells. It uses mostly the same attacks; and summons Quos and Shrads during the fight.

Advanced Cores drop from Xe-doms(cannon); the 'easiest' targets are Molybdenum Xe-doms that wander various low-altitude areas of Sylvalum.

Infiltrating Badr isn't particularly difficult; especially with a Skell; but you'll most likely have to fight a Milsaadi within the building containing the plans. You'll probably want AoE Skell arts for the defense; or else heavy beam/physical res to protect against their attacks.

Sturdy Drakebones drop from Millepods and Levitaths; the easiest drop would probably be the Welkin Levitaths that fly around N/E Primordia. The correct time to speak to Adappin is the morning(5:00~11:59); talking to him in the afternoon or nighttime will just hint that morning is the correct time.	The Industrial District Intel is near the north end of the bridge leading north from the food plant; the Ma-Non Ship Intel is on the lower level of the Starboard side; and the Residential Intel is south of the Ishmael Hills landmark. Choosing A will result in Kopopo becoming the xenoform representative; a more reasonable version of his Nopon 'tax' passes; resulting in increased Nopon spending and lots of profits for everyone else. Choosing B results in Sun'barac being elected and doing normal things.
